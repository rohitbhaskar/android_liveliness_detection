# Liveliness Detection Using a Dynamically Changing UI and Iris Tracking

We are building a dynamically changing interface and an iris tracking algorithm which can understand the liveliness (actual person vs his photo or video being shown to the camera) of a person based on his eyeâ€™s responses to the UI, without compromising on the usability of the UI itself.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

OpenCV 3.3+ (Python)

```
Windows Installation:
https://docs.opencv.org/3.3.1/d5/de5/tutorial_py_setup_in_windows.html

Linux Installation:
https://www.learnopencv.com/install-opencv3-on-ubuntu/
```

NodeJS 8+

```
Windows Installation:
(Has an easy executable file installation)
https://nodejs.org/en/download/ 

Linux Installation:
https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-node-js-on-ubuntu-16-04
```


### Installing

Steps to get youself a personal copy of the project running on your machine

Clone the project repo to your local machine

```
git clone git@github.com:rohitbhaskar/face_liveliness_detection.git
```

Get into the server directory with the node code

```
cd face_liveliness_detection/server/node_server
```

Run the nodeJS script

```
node index.js
```

Get into the server directory with the node code

```
cd face_liveliness_detection/server/node_server
```
End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
